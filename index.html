            Bitcoin is the world's first asset with a limited yet verifiable supply. <br>
            <br>
            
            The bitcoin block explorer shows the state of every wallet address. <br>
            <br>
            Every satoshi or sat (the smallest increment of a bitcoin) ever created has a record of which wallet it has lived.<br>
            <br>
            Bitcoin is often referred to as "Digital Gold" because both assets values are derived from their scarce supply.
